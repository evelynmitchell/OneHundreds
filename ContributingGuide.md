# Contributing Guide

## Pull requests

A pull request is a request to add or change a line of code in a shared repository. If you are making a change into your own repository, you would make a commit. The difference between a pull request and a commit, is the approval process. A pull request requires approval from the project owner and the maintainers of the project. A commit requires approval from the project owner, which would be you for a project you created or forked.

A repository is a collection of files and code that can be shared and modified, if the license permits, for your own needs. Repositories can be hosted on GitHub, such as this one is, or other hosting services. They include the history of changes over time, so you can go back to a previous version of a file if you need to.
