# One Hundreds

 Visakan Veerasamy in @visakanv's 50yr "plan" for global nerd network [wip] suggests 100 public attempts as a way of seeding collaboration with like minded creators, building an audience of true fans, and failing quickly in the direction of success.

I've got a few ideas for some projects that I'd like to share and I hope you will join me in coming up with more.

Also, if you start any of these projects, we'd love to hear about it.

The structure of so far, of this project is a single page, with organized by topic lists of inspiration for your projects. Each of the topics will, link to a Simon Willison's Datasette (https://datasette.io/ https://github.com/simonw/datasette) of locations of your versions of the project, for completeness, and eventually, show a random example of the last attempt of some of the projects. 

## Getting started

The initial list.

It's ok to start with something really easy. I recommend it over something even slightly hard, because 100s aren't about how hard the individual task are, but about building a habit of creating regularly to explore a theme or motive. We all learn through repetition, and no matter what you start with, the result will be interesting in aggregate. One hundred attempts at anything is interesting.

## Advice from people who've done some

Volume is more important than quality. You'll learn as you go. When you look back you'll see improvement and that will remind you of your learning over time.

Don't compare your beginning with someone else's final result. You haven't seen what they did in the beginning, because it's rarely shown. But asking for advice on how you can improve, is a great way to find collaborators and partners and even friends.
